# SetApp
A simple script---packaged inside a `.app` package---which I can use to get my school-issued MacBook Air up and running even faster. The idea is that I don't have to worry about getting a terminal downloaded and running without interference from any security systems (something which, surprisingly, is still an issue).

Simply speaking, it gets me to a point where I can run [setup](https://github.com/ErikBoesen/setup) without any other steps.

I also created this as a test case for [apper](https://github.com/ErikBoesen/apper).

Yes, I do write too many shell scripts.
